# Rule 201: The Alternating Turns Rule

Players shall alternate turns according to which army or armies they control. Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All players begin with a half chessboard (4 rows by 8 columns) and a standard half-set of International Chess Federation chess pieces placed upon it in the standard initial array.
