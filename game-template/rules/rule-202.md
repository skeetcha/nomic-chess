# Rule 202: The Turn Actions Rule

One turn consists of three parts in this order: (1) proposing one rule-change and having it voted on, (2) moving one's army (see rules [217](rule-217.md) and [219](rule-219.md)), and (3) taking control of any other players' armies if that army's king has been checkmated.
