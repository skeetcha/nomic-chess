# Rule 216: The Battling Order Rule

Before starting to play, the players choose which army goes first, which goes second, and so forth. This "batting order" is never changed.

Clarifications: According to [Rule 220](rule-220.md), players may come to be playing different armies than the ones they started with. It is important to remember that the batting order applies to the armies, not the players.
