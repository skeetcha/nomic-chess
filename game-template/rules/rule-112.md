# Rule 112: The Unchangeable Win Condition Rule

The state of affairs that constitutes winning may not be altered from eliminating all other players from the game to any other state of affairs. The rules for determining how a player is eliminated from the game may be changed, and rules that establish a winner when play cannot continue may be enacted and (while they are mutable) be amended or repealed.
