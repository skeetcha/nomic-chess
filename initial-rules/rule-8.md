# Rule 8: The Rook Rule

## Article 1
Each player will, at the beginning of the game, have control of two rooks. They begin sitting in the leftmost and rightmost squares of the bottom row on a playerâ€™s side.

## Article 2
The rook may, as a move, move in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically. The rook may not jump over any pieces. That is, if a rook must pass through another piece to move to an otherwise legal space, it cannot move to that space. It must move to the legal space just before the obstructing piece.
