# Rule 11: The Queen Rule

## Article 1
Each player will, at the beginning of the game, have control of one queen. It begins sitting in the square three spaces over from the leftmost square in the bottom row on a playerâ€™s side.

## Article 2
The queen may, as a move, move in a way similar to either a rook or a bishop. That is, it can move in any straight line, horizontal, vertical, or diagonal. The queen may not jump over any pieces. That is, if the queen must pass through another piece to move to an otherwise legal space, it cannot move to that space. It must move to the legal space just before the obstructing piece.
