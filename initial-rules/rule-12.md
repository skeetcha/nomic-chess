# Rule 12: The King Rule

## Article 1
Each player will, at the beginning of the game, have control of one king. It begins sitting in the square three spaces over from the rightmost square in the bottom row on a playerâ€™s side.

## Article 2
The king may, as a move, move in any direction, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. It can only move one space. It cannot move into a space that would leave the king in check (see [The Check Rule](rule-16.md), Article 1).
