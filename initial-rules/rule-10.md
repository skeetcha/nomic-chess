# Rule 10: The Bishop Rule

## Article 1
Each player will, at the beginning of the game, have control of two bishops. They begin sitting in the squares two spaces over from the leftmost and rightmost squares in the bottom row on a playerâ€™s side.

## Article 2
The bishop may, as a move, move in a straight diagonal line. The bishop may not jump over any pieces. That is, if a bishop must pass through another piece to move to an otherwise legal space, it cannot move to that space. It must move to the legal space just before the obstructing piece.
