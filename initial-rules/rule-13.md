# Rule 13: The Castling Rule

## Article 1
Castling is a special move. A king and a rook can move simultaneously in what is called a "Castling move."

## Article 2
The following conditions must be met for a castle to occur.

1. The king that makes the castling move has not yet moved from its initial square.
2. The rook that makes the castling move has not yet moved from its initial square.
3. The king is not in check (see [The Check Rule](rule-16.md), Article 1).
4. The king does not move over a square that is attacked by an enemy piece during the castling move (see [The Attacking Rule](rule-15.md), Article 1); that is, when castling, there may not be an enemy piece that can move to a square that is moved over by the king.
5. The king does not move to a square that is attacked by an enemy piece during the castling move (again, see [The Attacking Rule](rule-15.md), Article 1); that is, one may not castle and end the move with the king in check (again, see [The Check Rule](rule-16.md), Article 1).
6. All squares between the rook and king before the castling move are empty.
7. The king and rook must occupy the same row.

## Article 3
If all conditions listed in Article 2 are met, the king moves two squares towards the rook and the rook moves over the king to the next square.
