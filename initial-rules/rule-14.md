# Rule 14: The Pawn Rule

## Article 1
Each player will, at the beginning of the game, have control of eight pawns. They begin filling up the top row on a playerâ€™s side.

## Article 2
The pawn may, as a move, move forward only. It cannot move forward if a piece is obstructing a legal space.

## Article 3
The pawn attacks the square diagonally in front of the pawn in both directions (see [The Attacking Rule](rule-15.md), Article 1).

## Article 4
If a pawn has not moved from its initial position, it can be moved two spaces forward unless a piece already occupies that legal space.

## Article 5
If a pawn reaches the end of the board, it can be promoted to a queen, rook, knight, or bishop. It is then replaced by that piece. If none of the pieces that the pawn is being promoted to have been captured (see [The Capturing Rule](rule-17.md)), the pawn is still promoted possibly leading to scenarios such as three rooks, three bishops, three knights, or two queens.
