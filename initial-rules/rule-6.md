# Rule 6: The Board Size Rule

## Article 1
Each player is provided with half of a normal chessboard (that is, eight squares across and four squares down) to start their pieces on.

## Article 2
When a move is made to move a piece on the board (with regards to the pieceâ€™s rules), two half boards are combined and the legal move is made. Even if the legal move only takes place on one half of the board, the boards must still be combined. There are no restrictions on which half boards can be used.
